                yourselves! (Your first name, what country you live in, and what your duties are)</span><strong
                class="bold-text"><br />‍<br /></strong><span class="text-span-16">Oliwia:</span> Hi, my name is Oliwia
            or Ant, and I live in Belgium and my duty is making visual art.<br /><span
                class="text-span-17">Erika:</span> Hi my name is Erika and I’m from Italy and I&#x27;m a coordinator and
            copywriter.<br /><span class="text-span-18">Ritesh:</span> Greetings everyone my name is Ritesh im from
            Delhi and i handle the music side and technical side of ArtNet.Live.<br /><span
                class="text-span-19">Nivar:</span> My name is Nivar, I’m from Denmark and I&#x27;m a coordinator and
            content strategist.<br /><span
            class="text-span-19">Eve:</span> Hi I&#x27;m Eve and I live in America and my job duties are coordinator and
            copywriter.<br /><br /><span class="text-span-50">Jen: <em class="italic-text-2">How did everyone meet one
                    another? </em></span><strong><br />‍<br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-20"><strong>‍</strong>Erika:</span> We met on Grimes discord server, The Metaverse, and
            i think me and Oliwia started talking first and then Ritesh came along and Nivar too, and Eve was kinda like
            everywhere and was talking to everyone.<br /><br />Jen: <em>Tell us what inspired you to make ArtNet.Live?
            </em><strong><br />‍<br /></strong><span class="text-span-21"><strong>‍</strong>Oliwia</span>: It was pretty
            much Grimes because not only is she herself a visual artist, but also a music producer. It’s something that
            comes back around in our community. And it was fun to generally see the art and music from her fans and i
            think that that’s how the dialogue came alive in her official discord server, Ritesh started talking about
            it with a metaverse mod.<br />‍<br /><span class="text-span-22">Ritesh:</span> So back in 2019 I used to
            have a group of producers where we often discussed about creating a place for Unique artists, something like
            a music festival. But one day we were discussing about a music event at Grimes Metaverse and thought about a
            digital music festival, so Grimes Metaverse was a good opportunity to put the idea on the table and so yeah,
            we just made a team around. Oliwia became the face of the visual side ArtNet.Live, and then we have the
            whole team build in front of ourselves. We together build everything and somehow made things work out.
            <br /><br />Jen: <em>What was your vision for ArtNet.Live? </em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-23"><strong>‍</strong>Nivar:</span> It started out with us seeing our friends being
            talented and it sort of grew from there. We wanted to create a platform where we could all be free with our
            art and have fun and you know, grow with each other and just have a place that didn&#x27;t feel so
            controlling like the music industry does. <br /><br /><span class="text-span-26">Eve: </span>We saw so many
            people in Grimes discord who were sharing their work and, you know, they were pretty great, so we
            didn&#x27;t think they were getting the attention they deserved. So we thought it would be a good idea to
            build up a community just for them, where they could show off their work, where they could grow with other
            artists and collaborate and get the attention we believe that they deserve. <br /><br />Jen: <em>What was
                the process like to build and organise the server?</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-24">Nivar:</span> It initially started a few weeks before we heard Grimes being
            interested, we had created the server and it was kind of like, you know, bumpy on the road, we had some ups
            and downs while building the server and stuff like that. <br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-25">Oliwia:</span> There’s been some people doing stuff and hoping for us to fail but I
            think we took advantage of that which actually turned out for the best, we’re kind of independent now. But
            like, if you do it with a team that makes you feel safe, that understand the importance of it, it makes it
            much easier to organise a place that’s safe for everyone.<br /><br />Jen: <em>What is the best part of being
                on staff on a daily basis?</em><strong> <br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-27"><strong>‍</strong>Ritesh:</span> To be honest nothing beats that feeling when you
            see people noticing and appreciating something that whole team created after so many hardships, I genuinely
            feel good to see the talent who joined Artnet.live, it&#x27;s just so cool in many ways.<br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-28">Eve:</span> My power trip when i&#x27;m able to ban people, no i&#x27;m kidding.
            It’s being able to see the growth and talent that’s taking place in our community, it kinda makes me feel
            like a proud mom with just like you know, I can&#x27;t believe we have all these people with so much talent
            who are giving us their time and showing the work that they&#x27;ve been doing. Idk, it’s just very great.
            <br /><br />Jen: <em>What can we look out for in ArtNet.Live’s future?
            </em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span class="text-span-29">Erika:</span> I just hope we can reach a bigger
            audience one day, so the artists can get more recognition as they deserve because they’re amazing.
            <br /><br /><span class="text-span-30">Oliwia:</span> Previously we’ve had discussions of what to do next
            but right now we’re only focused on our discord stage, but we definitely talk a lot about expanding it to
            some virtual reality, there’s also lots of people asking if we’re planning to become a label, it’s
            interesting but I think we need much more time to discuss that because it’s actually like a huge thing. But
            I think there’s a lot of possibilities for us to like grow further. <br /><br />Jen: <em>What’s next for
                ArtNet? Any thoughts on expanding live events to diff platforms? Any thoughts on creating a label or irl
                live event one day? - Errunhrd </em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-31"><strong>‍</strong>Ritesh:</span> So, yes we will definitely expand ArtNet.Live to
            different platforms in the coming future, because Metaverse aka WEB3 is coming, so there&#x27;s like so many
            things we can do and we can create as a whole set of artists. And I think we will get our chances in the
            future to make ArtNet.Live a success in real life too, we’re just waiting for an opportunity. And a label
            would be cool but I think we’re more like an event, a supporting team, rather than money snatching labels,
            and so yea, that would be maybe good, maybe not, let&#x27;s see how it goes.<br /><br />Jen: <em>Will ArtNet
                try and reach out to bigger artists and collab with them? - Neural</em><br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-32">Nivar:</span> Yes, that&#x27;s an interesting question. I think it depends on the
            artist of course, like if they don&#x27;t fit or have the same goals or qualities as what we’re seeking then
            I don&#x27;t think that it would work out because we really like cherish originality and you know, being
            free with your art and not just following the main stream and such. Also, we’re not like a huge platform yet
            and I don&#x27;t think a lot of bigger artists would collaborate with someone who can’t either pay them or
            give them that recognition. So I mean, it depends on a few factors but we would for sure if they would like
            fit in with our goals yea. <br /><br />Jen: <em>What are some of the challenges you&#x27;ve faced trying to
                coordinate people from all over the world? - Georgia Bliss</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-33"><strong>‍</strong>Oliwia:</span> I think many different time zones, because people
            have their own lives, people go to work, people go to school, and when you have to bring together like a
            team of 10 people from all over the world it’s kind of confusing cause you respect that they have their own
            lives, but also at the same time you’re responsible for organisation of the different events. But at the end
            of the day everything always end up fine cause we’re kind of in the same boat, we’re interested in the same
            things, and we kind of represent each other. But I mostly think it’s just time zones. <br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-34">Eve:</span> I’d also like to add that when planning events it always kind of sucks
            knowing that we have to compromise and knowing that people are gonna miss out, but just you know, trying to
            get the majority to be able to participate and be there. <br /><br />Jen:<em> Do you as an artist feel like
                it is the end of humans making any “new” art? Is evolving A.I the way to create new melodies and artists
                find new ways to incorporate that A.I into their practice? - Cosmic
                Karma</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span class="text-span-35">Erika:</span> I feel like humans tend
            to forget about how things were in the past before us and that we didn&#x27;t have the things in the past
            available and yet people got used to them and moved on somehow. With AI I think that we should embrace new
            things and evolve with them somehow, like idk, make new art and appreciate technology, just evolve with them
            as we are in 2022 and we have to make new things in new ways. <br /><br />Jen: <em>What was the biggest
                challenge you had to overcome? - Sigma</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-36"><strong>‍</strong>Eve:</span> Honestly as we said before it’s pretty much people
            not being happy seeing others like ourselves doing somethings that a lot of people like and trying to knock
            it down for our success and for our hard work, it’s like, we struggled a lot with that, especially at the
            beginning. There were weeks where because of the different time zones we had to take turns like checking in
            on the server and like sleeping because we weren’t really getting any sleep time to make sure everything was
            running smoothly. <br /><br /><span class="text-span-37">Ritesh:</span> So when we started ArtNet.Live it
            was for Grimes, so when we left metaverse it was like totally independent, so we had to redesign everything
            and how we would proceed and do things, and like how we would figure out how to play the audio through the
            stage, so yea. Also We saw a weird type of rebellion against us like, idk, people are just stupid somehow
            that&#x27;s there job. But still We overcame everything that was in way and that was the best part, and
            Seeing our first event happening it was really euphoric feeling.<br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-38">Oliwia:</span> It sounds funny but like the first times we’ve been through some
            really bad shit w people on the internet cause they are like somehow envious of our success bc Grimes wanted
            to, you know she expressed she loved the idea and stuff, but I think if it wasn&#x27;t for that I don&#x27;t
            think we would have the connection we have right now.<br /><br /><span class="text-span-39">Eve:</span> Yea
            it was definitely disappointing losing out on the opportunity to work with her, but I think the way that it
            brought us all together to, like, lose that is really important to that way that our server is succeeding
            now.<br /><br />Jen: <em>Who is your least favourite and favourite member of staff? -
                Venshy</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span class="text-span-40">Oliwia:</span> I think on a serious
            note that if favouritism in a team is an actual thing then we wouldn&#x27;t be so close to each other, I
            personally love and respect everyone, everyone has different personalities. Idk it just connects the dots
            you know, I don&#x27;t think there’s something like having a least favourite because everyone’s doing
            different stuff but, um yea. I love the gaslighting venshy. <br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-41">Eve:</span> Each member of staff have their own ideas and personalities and ways
            that they choose to do things and we’ve had disagreements before but it&#x27;s nice to know that even when
            we don&#x27;t agree we can work on something and compromise to find the best solution to everything.
            <br /><br /><span class="text-span-42">Ritesh:</span> It&#x27;s so awesome how Erika handles the sitework,
            Oliwia handles the visual part, Eve moderates everything &amp; Nivar does the copywrite and make strategies
            and we have Jen, for hosting Artnet.live. We all just work together to make it possible so yea, everyone is
            important here and everyone is equally loved and that’s what I really appreciate.<br /><br /><span
                class="text-span-43">Nivar:</span> Yea, but like I love everyone so I couldn’t pick. Idk, to be a little
            evil and give Venshy a fun answer I some days have my favourites and some days don&#x27;t, like you know
            there’s days where you really appreciate someone more and there’s days where you love them all. Like I love
            them all all the time, but you get me right? Like a sibling or a parent there’s days where you’re like
            closer to one. <br /><br />Jen: <em>What is your motivation for Artnet? Why did you decide to make your
                contribution and invest your time? Ps: I love this server, the artists here inspire me so much, so
                thanks a lot that you created Artnet &lt;3 - Nyla</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-44">Ritesh:</span> The motivation for ArtNet.Live is to support artists, mostly people
            who doesn&#x27;t fall into any genre or any class. People who are unique and the artists who face mutual
            challenges all together, to build a place where everyone is comfortable, and where everyone is comfortable
            to show their own art, because not many people are open about their art because their art is an expression
            of themselves. So it&#x27;s important to have a place where you have liberty and freedom to express
            yourself.<br /><br /><span class="text-span-45">Nivar:</span> My motivation is like Nyla said how people get
            inspired in the server, it’s like very fulfilling to see.<br /><br />Jen: <em>As the community grows, are
                you afraid of losing your identity? - Sigma</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span
                class="text-span-46">Eve:</span> We’ve actually had this discussion before, it’s a very good question
            because it&#x27;s actually one of the things many of us disagreed with, like especially from discussing
            partnerships we have to find out whether they would be a good fit in our group. Some of us thought that we
            should like just take everybody, we didn&#x27;t think anyone shouldn’t be included and some of us were just
            like, you know, I think it would be losing our identity if we just started. You know it was originally
            supposed to be for people who don&#x27;t really fit into the mainstream and so we did agree on that, you
            know there has to be an opportunity for the people who usually don&#x27;t get that attention I guess to
            finally be able to get it. Idk, it&#x27;s a very complicated topic I think, but that’s what we’re trying to
            do.<br /><br /><span class="text-span-47">Oliwia:</span> I don&#x27;t think that’s gonna happen because idk,
            discord is filled with very weird people and you’re so much responsible for everyone’s safety and instead it
            just makes us more cautious and makes us think about our next steps, and I think we’re on the right side of
            like keeping ourselves in the project, I don&#x27;t think we’re gonna lose it anytime soon.<br /><br />Jen:
            <em>If had it not been for the Grimes community, what would artnet.live be? - Neo
                007</em><strong><br /><br /></strong><span class="text-span-48">Erika:</span> I mean considering we met
            thanks to it, maybe nothing? Idk, maybe but in a romantic way I like to think that it was destiny somehow,
            it’s like thanks to the Grimes community we met one another and made a group project, so maybe, maybe
            nothing. It was destiny, it was fate.
